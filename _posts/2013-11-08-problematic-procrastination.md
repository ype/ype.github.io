<span class="dropcap">It</span> never ceases to amaze me how long I can procrastinate before
actually deciding to get shit done. It would maybe be not as troubling
if I hated what I do on a daily basis, or the work that I had to get
done was mind numbing dull, but it&rsquo;s unfortunately not (I saw
unfortunately because then I would have an excuse as to why I&rsquo;m a lazy
sod).

## Brief notes on a day

I would like to say I wake up energised and rearing to go, but like
most, I wake in a fog, dragging my sulking ass out of bed, trying
desperately to summon some celestial force to help me muster the focus
to stay on track with tasks I need to get done. Side note: Freelance
is the procrastinators worst nightmare (although I have found many a
way to procrastinate in a normal work environment as well, see also:
reverse toilet sleeping)

After raking large amounts of crust from my tired eyes I start my
already behind day with a cup of tea and a wonderfully delicious
cigarette (if you don&rsquo;t smoke you should try it, really it&rsquo;s a lot of
fun (no sarcasm, just pure smoking love))

Smoking and tea drinking over, I either turn on some stupid cartoon on
one of a handful of streaming TV websites and proceed to say at the
end of every episode &ldquo;after this one I&rsquo;ll get to work&rdquo; - this has
become problematic to the point that I downloaded an app to block
specific sites (unfortunately I never turn this app on).

Once TV show watching has been completed I continue doing absolutely
useless, time wasting activities - one of my favourite being the
aimless pursuit of customising Emacs to the point of insanity.

## The Emacs Curse

I believe Richard Stallman whilst designing Emacs, deviously devised
to create a piece of shit, almost text editor, time vampire that was
more addictive then Facebook or all its other time sucking
compadres.

Half serial time killer, half insane genius, Stallman created the bane
of my existence, as for some reason I feel as though changing my
dotemacs file is somehow kind of like doing actual work - this is not
the case.

## The calm after the storm

With the drudge through the wasteland that is my morning over, actual
money making, cash flowing work can begin - this usually means
possibly taking a shower and then eating food so that around 3pm I can
start sewing, soldering, or hacking some slapped together, haphazardly
made project together.

All in all work does get done and deadlines are hit, but oh how I
crave the day when this process is mitigated down to a streamline
flow making a 40 hour work week possibly possible.

# In (ardently needed) conclusion

It&rsquo;s a love hate thing in my opinion - procrastination is beautiful -
almost wonderful to say the least - the unfortunate part is that
ignorance does not exist, making it virtually impossible to forget the
fact that if all the chaff could be removed, I might actually build
something useful for myself, and possibly others.

Another 20 minutes down the drain writing this god forsaken pile of
empty words - I really hope you didn&rsquo;t read to the end of this - if so
go to some work, or find a better blog to read.

I like turtles.
