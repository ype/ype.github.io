I decided, one fateful day (or maybe not so fateful, but rather
ill-conceived) - that it would be a good idea to blog using orgmode. I
use orgmode for many things - scheduling, expenses, charts of varying
kind, time-tracking, the list goes on. Blogging in org seemed like a
natural extension of this already ill-fated, ill-conceived, awesomely
nerd trapped system I have developed for myself.

## How it all came together

This blog uses a combination of a few tools that have become very dear
to me - the aforementioned orgmode, ispell (because I&rsquo;m using friggin
emacs to write all this drivel), a ruby static site generator - nanoc,
and some hacked together bits of code (one of which is org-ruby, I&rsquo;ll
explain this one in detail at a later time - there is a surprisingly
limited amount of documentation on how to use it effectively)

All of this heaping junk pile of snippets has come together in
isoty.pe - my effort to help clog the stinking drain that the Internet
has become (don&rsquo;t get me wrong I spend a good majority of my time in
this cesspool of delights).

## In [very needed] Conclusion

I feel I should warn, alert, tell you what you will encounter on this
site - don&rsquo;t be afraid, it&rsquo;s not a NSFW warning (it could be a little
though I guess, as your boss probably would not enjoy you wasting
endless hours looking at pointless pictures of pandas) - the site is
my endless hacking, tweaking, replace-stringing of the various tools I
use on a daily basis to GSD (for the GTD crowd GSD is my version where
I replace the David Allen acronym &ldquo;Get Things Down&rdquo; with the more
work appropriate &ldquo;Get Shit Done&rdquo;)

I hope you enjoy this journey to the deep, bon voyage to sanity, this
different, but hopefully better foray into Internet cesspiting.
