I’m a DevOps/Platform Engineer with a passion for connecting things together. As a person who builds what’s in the box, as well as the box itself - I continually look for new ways to combine my love of digital interfaces with embedded designs. I enjoy the challenge of making systems more human and looking for solutions that bridge the gap between digital environments and physical interactions.
