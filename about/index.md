title: About some stuff.

Hi, my name is Anton, and I like colouring, long walks on the beach,
and getting caught in almost inevitable London rain.

Here's a bit about me...

I Code in (depending on the day and type of project):

- Python
- JavaScript
- C++
- Embedded C
- Java
- UNIX Shell
- Perl
- R
- HTML
- CSS+SASS
- Clojure
- Common Lisp
- SQL

I Build Embedded whatchamacallits with:

- ARM Processors
- Raspberry Pi
- Parallella

I usually can be found using Mac OS X (a very hacked up version, that
is perfectly mine)

<div class="message">
When I edit text I use the editor of RSI crippled champions, Emacs.
</div>

If I find myself bored I'll be most likely booting up Linux (Kali) to
dabble around running random PyCuda scripts trying to crack my WiFi or
crush my server in a hopes of rebuilding it on-top of the rubble, stronger and more impenetrable then it was before.

Some things that interest me are...

> GPU Accelerated Computing with Python, wearables, modular synthesis,
> embedded systems design, creative coding, Emacs, music production,
> foley, sound engineering, monome, open source software, MAKE magazine,
> 3D Printing, screen printing, carpentry, hardware hacking, and typography.

if you wanna know more, look at my CV - it's got similar stuff plus a
bit more extra suit and tie sort of business stuff.
