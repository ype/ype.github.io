Hi, my name is Anton, and I like colouring, long walks on the beach,
and getting caught in almost inevitable London rain.

I'm a electronics building, code hacking, e-textiles sewing,
unfortunately jaded individual - who uses Emacs out of spite.

- Designing [[http://muushi.ilyfa.com][3D Touch Interfaces]] out of fabric
