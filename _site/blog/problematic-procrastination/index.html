	<p><span class="dropcap">It</span> never ceases to amaze me how long I can procrastinate before
actually deciding to get shit done. It would maybe be not as troubling
if I hated what I do on a daily basis, or the work that I had to get
done was mind numbing dull, but it&rsquo;s unfortunately not (I saw
unfortunately because then I would have an excuse as to why I&rsquo;m a lazy
sod).</p>

<h2>Brief notes on a day</h2>

<p>I would like to say I wake up energised and rearing to go, but like
most, I wake in a fog, dragging my sulking ass out of bed, trying
desperately to summon some celestial force to help me muster the focus
to stay on track with tasks I need to get done. Side note: Freelance
is the procrastinators worst nightmare (although I have found many a
way to procrastinate in a normal work environment as well, see also:
reverse toilet sleeping)</p>

<p>After raking large amounts of crust from my tired eyes I start my
already behind day with a cup of tea and a wonderfully delicious
cigarette (if you don&rsquo;t smoke you should try it, really it&rsquo;s a lot of
fun (no sarcasm, just pure smoking love))</p>

<p>Smoking and tea drinking over, I either turn on some stupid cartoon on
one of a handful of streaming TV websites and proceed to say at the
end of every episode &ldquo;after this one I&rsquo;ll get to work&rdquo; - this has
become problematic to the point that I downloaded an app to block
specific sites (unfortunately I never turn this app on).</p>

<p>Once TV show watching has been completed I continue doing absolutely
useless, time wasting activities - one of my favourite being the
aimless pursuit of customising Emacs to the point of insanity.</p>

<h2>The Emacs Curse</h2>

<p>I believe Richard Stallman whilst designing Emacs, deviously devised
to create a piece of shit, almost text editor, time vampire that was
more addictive then Facebook or all its other time sucking
compadres.</p>

<p>Half serial time killer, half insane genius, Stallman created the bane
of my existence, as for some reason I feel as though changing my
dotemacs file is somehow kind of like doing actual work - this is not
the case.</p>

<h2>The calm after the storm</h2>

<p>With the drudge through the wasteland that is my morning over, actual
money making, cash flowing work can begin - this usually means
possibly taking a shower and then eating food so that around 3pm I can
start sewing, soldering, or hacking some slapped together, haphazardly
made project together.</p>

<p>All in all work does get done and deadlines are hit, but oh how I
crave the day when this process is mitigated down to a streamline
flow making a 40 hour work week possibly possible.</p>

<h1>In (ardently needed) conclusion</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s a love hate thing in my opinion - procrastination is beautiful -
almost wonderful to say the least - the unfortunate part is that
ignorance does not exist, making it virtually impossible to forget the
fact that if all the chaff could be removed, I might actually build
something useful for myself, and possibly others.</p>

<p>Another 20 minutes down the drain writing this god forsaken pile of
empty words - I really hope you didn&rsquo;t read to the end of this - if so
go to some work, or find a better blog to read.</p>

<p>I like turtles.</p>
